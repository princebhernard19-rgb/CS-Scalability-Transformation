# CloudScale: Customer Success Scalability Transformation
## Project Tier Zero: Reducing Support Friction via AI & Automation

### 🚀 Executive Summary
A strategic initiative to scale Customer Success impact at a B2B SaaS company by 20% without increasing headcount. This project moved the department from a "Reactive Ticket Shop" to a "Proactive Success Engine."

### 📊 The Problem
- **Status:** Drowning in Tier 1 tickets (Average 0.8 tickets/user).
- **Churn:** Creeping up to 5%.
- **Efficiency:** CSMs spending 60% of their time on manual, repetitive tasks.

### 🛠️ Solution & Architecture
1. **AI Chatbot (Gemini-Powered):** Implemented a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) flow to index the KB.
2. **In-App Guidance:** Deployed logic-based tooltips on the Billing and Integrations pages.
3. **Data-Driven KB:** Analyzed top 20 ticket drivers to rewrite documentation for "Self-Service First."

### 📈 Key Results (Q3)
- **20%** Tier 1 Ticket Automation.
- **15-day** Reduction in Onboarding Time (Time-to-Value).
- **0** New hires required to handle a 15% increase in user volume.
